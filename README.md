Gun homicides in the United States have witnessed a significant increase of 45.5% since 2004, despite a concurrent rise of 46.6% in police budgets specifically within Boston, MA over the past decade[1][2]. This underscores the imperative for enhanced and data-informed policing strategies. Within the jurisdiction of the Boston Police Department encompassing 89.6 square miles and serving a resident population of 675,632 (not accounting for the annual influx of 22.7 million visitors), there is a notable challenge in controlling crime[3]. This challenge is further amplified by the fact that the department has only 2,139 officers at their disposal[4]. The combination of these factors underscores the critical need to ensure that law enforcement units are strategically positioned in areas with higher crime rates. This strategic positioning is essential to providing immediate support and potentially act as a deterrent to criminal activities.This report will examine the spatial and temperoal trends of crime throughout Boston from 2015-2018 with the goal of providing increased insight for the Boston Police Department.

Our report delves into various aspects of crime in Boston, employing a multifaceted approach to understand and address the challenges faced by the Boston Police Department. The analysis begins with Descriptive Statistics, comparing crime rates between districts. A temporal perspective is provided through a Timeseries Analysis on Criminal Activity, forecasting trends through 2020, considering factors like the Holiday Effect and the Home-Game Effect. The subsequent section introduces a Model comparing Type 1 Crimes to shootings, exploring the correlation between the events. An investigation into the temporal patterns of shootings examines their frequency in the evenings and the role of streetlights as a deterent. Geospatial insights are derived through a Heat Map, complemented by an in-depth Geospatial Analysis, identifying the center of 'crime' and hotspots through unsupervised clustering. Additionally, the proximity of liquor sales and hospitals to shooting incidents is explored. Throughout, the hypothesis is that crime is linked to population size, time of year, population dynamics, and spatial location, providing a holistic perspective for law enforcement strategies in Boston.
